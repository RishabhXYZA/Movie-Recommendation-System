## 📖 Introduction

With the growing number of movies available across streaming platforms, choosing what to watch has become overwhelming.  
CineSense addresses this problem by analyzing movie features such as genres, overview, keywords, and cast information to recommend **contextually similar movies**.

The system focuses on:
- Accurate recommendations
- Simple and intuitive UI
- Fast response using precomputed similarity
- Real-world deployment-ready architecture

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run CineSense locally, you need the following:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip package manager
- TMDB API key
- Docker (optional for containerized deployment)
- Modern web browser
- Core libraries and tools listed in `requirements.txt`, usually including:
   - `flask`
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `requests`
   - `gunicorn`
   - `scikit-learn`

### 📥 Installing dependencies
You can install all required libraries with a single command.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⚙️ Installation
Follow these steps to run CineSense locally.

1. **Clone the repository.**

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RishabhXYZA/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
    cd Movie-Recommendation-System
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment.**  
   This step is optional but recommended to isolate dependencies.

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment.**

   - On Linux and macOS:

     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install Python dependencies.**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set TMDB API key**  
   Create an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
  (On Windows, use set instead of export.)

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Start the Flask application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. **Open your browser**
   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
3. **Select a movie**

   Choose a movie from the dropdown list.

4. **Get recommendations**

   The system displays similar movies along with posters fetched from TMDB.
